# MalwareDetection

**Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction**

1. By doing basic analysis of features, we can observe that many features are unrelated to malware detection/prediction and can be dropped

-MachineIdentifier <br/>
-LocaleEnglishNameIdentifier <br/>
-Census_InternalBatteryType <br/>
-Census_InternalBatteryNumberOfCharges <br/>
-Census_OSInstallLanguageIdentifier <br/>
-Census_InternalPrimaryDiagonalDisplaySizeInInches <br/>
-Census_InternalPrimaryDisplayResolutionHorizontal <br/>
-Census_InternalPrimaryDisplayResolutionVertical <br/>
-Census_OSUILocaleIdentifier <br/>
-Census_IsTouchEnabled <br/>
-Census_IsPenCapable <br/>
-Census_IsAlwaysOnAlwaysConnectedCapable <br/>
-Wdft_RegionIdentifier <br/>

2. By looking at the % of null/empty values of columns, we can observe some features can be dropped

column                                                % empty<br/>

-PuaMode                                              99.9741 <br/>
-Census_ProcessorClass                                99.5894 <br/>
-DefaultBrowsersIdentifier                            95.1416 <br/>
-Census_IsFlightingInternal                           83.0440 <br/>
<br/>
80.0000 was taken as threshold
<br/>
<br/>
3. By looking at the unbalancedness of the feature values (i.e most of the values belonging to a single class), we can see that some features can be dropped

 column                             % unbalancedness     unique_vals

-Census_IsWIMBootEnabled             99.999969           2<br/>
-IsBeta                              99.999249           2<br/>
-Census_IsFlightsDisabled            99.998996           2<br/>
-AutoSampleOptIn                     99.997108           2<br/>
-Census_ThresholdOptIn               99.974924           2<br/>
-SMode                               99.953708           2<br/>
-Census_IsPortableOperatingSystem    99.945480           2<br/> 
-Census_DeviceFamily                 99.838256           3<br/>
-UacLuaenable                        99.392547           11<br/>
-Census_IsVirtualDevice              99.296055           2<br/>

99.0000 was taken as threshold<br/>

4. By looking at the correlation plot, we can drop some features <br/>

 Feature 1 vs Feature 2   =  corr<br/>

-AvSigVersion vs EngineVersion = 0.97<br/>
-IsSxsPassiveMode vs RtpStateBitfield = -0.90<br/>
-IeVerIdentifier vs OsBuildLab = 0.91<br/>
-OsVer vs Platform = 0.99<br/>
-SkuEdition vs OsSuite = -0.90<br/>
-Census_OSEdition vs Census_OSSkuName = 1.00 <br/>
-Census_OSVersion vs Census_OSBuildNumber = 0.97<br/>
-Census_OSArchitecture vs Processor = 1.0<br/>

The following features were removed in the above case<br/>

-EngineVersion (AvSigVersion conveys more info than EngineVersion )<br/>
-RtpStateBitfield (IsSxsPassiveMode conveys more info than RtpStateBitfield )<br/>
-IeVerIdentifier (OsBuildLab conveys more info than IeVerIdentifier )<br/>
-Platform (OsVer has more unique values than Platform)<br/>
-SkuEdition (OsSuite is numerical though it may be categorical and SkuEdition is a nominal variable)<br/>
-Census_OSSkuName (Census_OSEdition has more unique values than Census_OSSkuName)<br/>
-Census_OSBuildNumber (Census_OSVersion conveys more info than Census_OSBuildNumber)<br/>
-Processor (Census_OSArchitecture conveys more info than Processor)<br/>
<br/>
After removing all the features, there are 2 features which have a significant % of missing values<br/>
<br/>
column                                                % empty<br/>

-SmartScreen                                          35.6108<br/>
-OrganizationIdentifier                               30.8415<br/>

The missing values in SmartScreen can be replaced by it's default value which is RequireAdmin. Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SmartScreen<br/>

The missing values in OrganizationIdentifier can be replaced by 0.<br/>

All this is done by feature.py<br/>

Additonally, notebook called "Malware Detection by Exploratory Territory.ipynb" provides data visualization along with contents of feature.py to back the feature choice and dropping.<br/>

Steps to run :<br/>

1) Install all requirements numpy,matplotlib,pandas and seaborn (all are there in kaggle)
2) Additionally install chart_studio (from kaggle console in case of kaggle) for ploting plots using plotly.  
3) Change the path of the train.csv in "Loading the data" part use /kaggle/input/microsoft-malware-prediction/train.csv as path if using it in kaggle
4) Change path of the destination where the new_train.csv must be stored
<br/>
The new csv will have all the unwanted features removed.
